# Budget Tracker
Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge

## Description
A basic budget tracking app designed to be able to function offline.

## How To Use
Enter a name and amount for the transaction and then hit the "Add Funds" buttons to add the amount to the balance or the "Subtract Funds" button to subtract funds from the balance. When you add or subtract funds from the balance the new total should be displayed and the graph tracking the total balance should update.
If the user enters an amount without an internet connection or with a poor internet connection, the info should be saved via IndexedDB and added when the connection is restored.

## Built With
MongoDB
<br> Node.js
<br> Express.js
